    "For c, the average number of hits is 9.27, which is the highest among the provided experiments. The median and mode are both 9 or 10, which shows that most trials resulted in a high number of hits. The minimum is 7, suggesting that even in the worst-case scenarios, there are relatively high hits. In general this shows a very good performance.\n",
